Sazadur is a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Central Florida. He is affiliated with both ECE and CS department at UCF under the "<a href='https://cyber.cs.ucf.edu/'>Cyber Security and Privacy Cluster</a>". Before joining UCF, Sazadur was a Security Architecture Engineer at Intel Corporation working in security hardening and threat modeling of next generation Xeon processors. He earned his Ph.D. and M.Sc. from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida under the supervision of Prof. Mark Tehranipoor at FICS Lab. Earlier, Sazadur received the B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.

Before starting his graduate studies, Sazadur was a design engineer in different fabless semiconductor companies for four years to work on industrial scale 28nm and 14nm custom ICs. He has co-authored more than twenty peer-reviewed research papers, three patents (1 granted), one textbook, and several book-chapters during his Doctoral degree. His research works are showcased in premier ACM/IEEE journals and conferences, including the Design Automation Conference (DAC), Design Automation and Test in Europe (DATE), IEEE International Test Conference (ITC), IEEE Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST), Elsevier Integration, and ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems (TODAES).
