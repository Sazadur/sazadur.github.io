    Secure silicon design by in-house developed custom standard cells.

In addition to developing countermeasures for IP protection, I implemented my developed novel techniques in application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) to ensure manufacturability and demonstrate real-life applicability. I lead a team of ten (10) graduate students at FICS lab, ECE, University of Florida, to implement our developed security solutions in a 65nm TSMC process technology using in-house developed custom standard cells. We implemented physical attack-resistant IP protection methods in AES and open-source benchmark circuits along with the baseline design. We utilized commercial EDA tools from Synopsys and Cadence for synthesis, design, implementation, and verification. To facilitate the post-silicon experimental demonstration, we used a glass lid to perform different packaging, e.g., COB and DIP.
