Hardware security community mostly focused on untrusted foundry business model when talking about IP piracy or tampering. However, with CHIPS act., cutting-edge fabrication facilities and ecosystem will be inside US. Therefore, the notion of untrusted foundry will no longer exist and threats from insider will emerge. My work on LUT based fine-grained IP redaction has the potential to secure supply chain against insider threats. Please note that this is a very difficult threat model compared to untrusted foundry as all the parties in the supply chain is untrusted here.
