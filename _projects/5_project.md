Traditionally EDA tools used for IC design, are installed in local machine. However, cloud-based EDA tools are taking that place now. IC design is an extremely complicated process. For example, a typical placement step considers 10^250 times more possibilities than a go/chess game. AI is empowering these steps to reduce the search space. Moreover, the sensitive design data and processing in cloud require more comprehensive protection than before. I plan to expand my work in this domain to perform optimization and security assessment with cloud-EDA platform. My vast experience with commercial EDA tools puts me in an ideal position to carry out this research.
